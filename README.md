## Background

Ghost cycles are a class of limit cycles characterized by the presence of one or more **ghost attractors** along the orbit. These ghost attractors sequentially capture trajectories, leading to a separation of timescalesâ€”reminiscent of slow-fast dynamical systems.

This study explores the dynamics of ghost cycles under periodic forcing and compares them with classical slow-fast oscillators. The findings highlight how **criticality**â€”the proximity to a bifurcation pointâ€”governs both the **response dynamics** and **entrainment behavior** of these systems.

The concept of ghost cycles was first introduced in:  
[Koch D., et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 047202 (2024)](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.047202)

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

To recreate the figures and simulations, youâ€™ll need:

- Python 3.x  
- Required Python packages (installable via `ghostCycles_pythonEnvironment.yaml`)

To set up the environment, run:

```bash
conda env create -f ghostCycles_pythonEnvironment.yaml
conda activate ghostCycles

Running Code

    Main Figures:
    Run any of the FigureX.py scripts (e.g. Figure1.py, Figure2.py, etc.) to generate the main figures from the paper.

    Supplementary Figures & Videos:
    Use SupplementaryFigureX.py and SupplementaryVideos.py to reproduce additional analyses and visuals.

    Ensure that models.py and functions.py are located in the same directory as the script you're executing.

Bifurcation Analysis

Bifurcation diagrams can be generated using the models provided in the XPP files directory.

To perform bifurcation analysis:

    Install XPP/XPPAUT

    Open the .ode files using XPP

    Follow the simulation instructions included in the comments of each file
