## Background

Ghost cycles are a class of limit cycles characterized by the presence of one or more **ghost attractors** that are visited sequentially along the orbit and which transiently capture trajectories, leading to a separation of timescales—reminiscent of slow-fast dynamical systems. The concept of ghost cycles was first introduced in: [Koch D. et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 047202 (2024)](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.047202).

This study explores the dynamics of ghost cycles under periodic forcing and compares them with classical slow-fast oscillators. The findings highlight how **criticality**—the proximity to a bifurcation point—governs the response dynamics of periodically forced ghost cycles.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

To recreate the figures and simulations, you’ll need:

- Python 3.x  
- Required Python packages (installable via the environment `ghostCycles_pythonEnvironment.yaml`)

### Running Code

- Main Figures:
Run any of the `FigureX.py` scripts (e.g. `Figure1.py`, `Figure2.py`, etc.) to generate the main figures from the paper.

Supplementary Figures & Videos:
- Use `SupplementaryFigureX.py` and `SupplementaryVideos.py` to reproduce additional analyses and visuals.

Ensure that `models.py` and `functions.py` are located in the parent directory of the script you're executing.

### Bifurcation Analysis

Bifurcation diagrams can be generated using the models provided in the XPP files directory. For running the `.ode` files you need to install [XPP/XPPAUT](https://sites.pitt.edu/~phase/bard/bardware/xpp/xpp.html).
